Test projects with Angular NGRX state manager<br/>
This project is based on Paul Halliday's introduction course to NGRX:<br/>
https://developer.school/introduction-to-ngrx-store/ <br/><br/>

There's another tool used in this project which is worth mentioning - It's JSON SERVER, a simple mock REST API based on json files, which is perfect for testing server side calls.<br/>
